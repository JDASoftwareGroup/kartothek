Kartothek Cubes
***************

This package contains code to deal with multiple `Kartothek` datasets. It was built with the experience that we at
`Blue Yonder`_ collected over around one year.

The semantics in Kartothek Cubes are centered around something called :term:`Cube`, loosely modeled after `Data Cubes`_. One cube
is made by multiple `Kartothek` datasets. User-facing APIs are mostly consume and provide `Pandas`_ DataFrames.
