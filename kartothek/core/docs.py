        This parameter is not compatible with filter_query.

        Predicates are expressed in disjunctive normal form (DNF). This means
        that the innermost tuple describes a single column predicate. These
        inner predicates are all combined with a conjunction (AND) into a
        larger predicate. The most outer list then combines all predicates
        with a disjunction (OR). By this, we should be able to express all
        kinds of predicates that are possible using boolean logic.

        Available operators are: `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>` and `in`.

        Filtering for missings is supported with operators `==`, `!=` and
        `in` and values `np.nan` and `None` for float and string columns
        respectively.

            When using order sensitive operators on categorical data we will
            assume that the categories obey a lexicographical ordering.
