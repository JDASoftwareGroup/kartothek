        This parameter is not compatible with filter_query.

        Predicates are expressed in disjunctive normal form (DNF). This means
        that the innermost tuple describes a single column predicate. These
        inner predicates are all combined with a conjunction (AND) into a
        larger predicate. The most outer list then combines all predicates
        with a disjunction (OR). By this, we should be able to express all
